# Decision-Tree-Regressor-Classification-from-scratch
An implementation of decision trees for regression and classification which handle categorical and continuous features. 
The algorithms are tested on the notorious Titanic and Iris datasets. The accuracy achieved is compared against the industry standard implmentation in Sklearn registering minimal divergence.
